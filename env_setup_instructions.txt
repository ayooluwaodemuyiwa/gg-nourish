To run the GG Delivery bot, you need to create a .env file with the following content:

DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token_here
MISTRAL_API_KEY=your_mistral_api_key_here
UBER_EATS_API_KEY=your_uber_eats_api_key_here

Steps to get these tokens:

1. Discord Token:
   - Visit https://discord.com/developers/applications
   - Create a new application or select an existing one
   - Navigate to the "Bot" section
   - Click "Reset Token" to get a new token (or copy your existing one)
   - Enable the following intents:
     * Message Content Intent
     * Server Members Intent
   - Copy the token and paste it in your .env file

2. Mistral API Key:
   - Sign up or log in at https://mistral.ai/
   - Navigate to your account settings or API dashboard
   - Generate a new API key
   - Copy the key and paste it in your .env file

3. Uber Eats API Key (Optional):
   - If you have access to the Uber Eats API, you can add your API key here
   - Without this key, the bot will use mock data for food recommendations
   - The mock data includes sample restaurants and menus for testing purposes
   - For production use, obtain an API key from the Uber Developer Portal

Once you have the required tokens:
1. Create a new file named ".env" in the gg-delivery directory
2. Paste the content shown above with your actual tokens
3. Save the file
4. Run the bot with: python run_bot.py
